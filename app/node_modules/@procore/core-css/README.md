An implementation of Procore's Web Design Guidelines.

## Requirements

Node 6+
NPM or Yarn

## Background

Our styles are organized according to [`Inverted Triangle CSS`](https://www.xfive.co/blog/itcss-scalable-maintainable-css-architecture/). ITCSS organizes stylesheets by _specificity_. Read the article linked above for more information.

## Developing

To get started, type the following from the root directory:

```
yarn
yarn dev
```

## Testing

Testing currently consists of Jest snapshot testing on our React storybook components. To run the test suite use the following command:
```
yarn test
```

## Building

```
yarn build
```

Once the project is done building, the docs can be viewed  at `build/docs/index.html`
