## CORE Icons ![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@procore/core-icons.svg) ![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/dt/@procore/core-icons.svg)

A set of SVGs turned into a web compatible `@font-face`.

## Requirements

Node 6+
NPM or Yarn

## Developing

To get started, type the following from the root directory:

```
yarn
yarn dev
```

## Building

```
yarn build
```

## Updating in [IcoMoon](https://icomoon.io/)

1. Name icons according to the following naming convention:
```
tool-?[name]-[shape]-[o]-[direction]
```

2. Select the entire font set and select "Generate Font"

3. Download the font archive

4. If icons have not yet been updated in the current prerelease, the `src/selection-old.json` file must be replaced with the `src/selection.json`. Otherwise nothing needs to be done on this step.

5. Extract the downloaded font archive contents into the `src` folder, overwriting the existing files.

6. Check on localhost that the icons appear on the Icons docs
